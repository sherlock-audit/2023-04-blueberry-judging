# IchiSpell#_withdraw attempts to limit slippage but applies slippage limit to user supplied data making it ineffective

## Summary

IchiSpell#_withdraw attempts to limit slippage but applies slippage limit to user supplied data making it completely ineffective. Slippage limits protect the protocol in the event that a malicious user wants to extract value via swaps, this is an important protection in the event that a user finds a way to trick collateral requirements. 

## Vulnerability Detail

[IchiSpell.sol#L210-L222](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/IchiSpell.sol#L210-L222)

            SWAP_POOL = IUniswapV3Pool(vault.pool());
            uint160 deltaSqrt = (param.sqrtRatioLimit *
                uint160(param.sellSlippage)) / uint160(Constants.DENOMINATOR);
            SWAP_POOL.swap(
                address(this),
                // if withdraw token is Token0, then swap token1 -> token0 (false)
                !isTokenA,
                amountToSwap.toInt256(),
                isTokenA
                    ? param.sqrtRatioLimit + deltaSqrt
                    : param.sqrtRatioLimit - deltaSqrt, // slippaged price cap
                abi.encode(address(this))
            );

We can see above that the slippage values are applied on top of user supplied slippage data which means that it is completely ineffective. Assume the protocol wishes to limit slippage to 3%. The user can specify a slippage value of 3% and this would add another 3% allowing the user 6% slippage. The user can specify any slippage value they wish and the 3% will be added on top making it completely ineffective. 

## Impact

Slippage limits can be bypassed
